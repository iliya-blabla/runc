#Hello
Thank you for taking the time to read this text and project
### Description
##### There are a few points related to this project:

- Usually all installation and configuration tasks, system hardening are done automatically, but to make it easier to evaluate, I did them manually
- The passwords in the files are in clear text and not complex
- I refused to do best practices and anything that wasn't asked of me so as not to waste the reader's time and complicate the testing project
- I usually provide documents in English and in markdown format

- It is possible to send Ansible files and add them as soon as possible

- It is possible to provide documents in Persian in PDF format as soon as possible

### Problem:
Due to my lack of proficiency in Python and the failure to submit it with the task and the word **"assume"** in the text of the task, it was not possible to implement the Python project,
(I raised this via email)

#### The solutions:

- I will add an application to the project using golang that connects to the database and runs its tests.
- I will not check the application's connection to the database and use AI to write a simple Python program that only checks the compose files
