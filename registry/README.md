Usually we install and configure nexus with ansible and nexus apis and put the passwords in valt, but considering that we do these steps manually and do not use orchestration, the passwords are in the .env file and are not complex, which we change after installation.

#### To-do list:
[x] create docker compose
[x] run compose file
[x] change root password
[x] Removing default repositories
